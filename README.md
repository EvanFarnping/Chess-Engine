A Python chess engine [WORK IN PROGRESS]. This project is a hard work in progress. 
The current state of the project is in no way complete, optimized, or proper in any shape or form.
See DOCUMENTATION.txt to know more about goals, purpose, design choices, etc., as that is what is considered the "dev-log."
Once completed, or is at a satisfactory state, this README will reflect that.
